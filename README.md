# Reed-s-TI-84-Plus-CE-Repository
A collection of TI-BASIC programs for the TI-84 Plus CE  
ADVNTR - a very short adventrue rpg I thought about programming  
ANGCON - convert degrees to radians or vice versa  
BIGFCT - Lists all factors of a number  
CAMFLY - A simple stroy about a boy who could fly. (Requires ONESEC)  
COLATZ - a simple program to test the colatz conjecture for a single number  
COLTES - tests the colatz conjecture for all integers  
COLNEW - a version of COLTES with a new method for determingin odd and even numbers  
*note: I havent been able to gget either of the programs to run past 64 ever since I updated the OS on my calculator*  
*funny story: COLNEW once ran until the calculator ran out of battery which clears the ram and all programs*  
*TLDR: COLNEW managed to delete itself*
