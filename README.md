# Reed-s-TI-84-Plus-CE-Repository
A collection of TI-BASIC programs for the TI-84 Plus CE  
I wrote all of these a logn time ago and I've forgotten what they do or how they work. I made an attempt to figure out what most of them do, but some of them still elude me. Some of them also need to be fixed and updated, but these programs were never meant to be professional or even see the light of day.  
ADVNTR - a very short adventrue rpg I thought about programming  
ANGCON - convert degrees to radians or vice versa  
BIGFCT - Lists all factors of a number  
CAMFLY - A simple stroy about a boy who could fly. (Requires ONESEC)  
COLATZ - a simple program to test the colatz conjecture for a single number  
COLTES - tests the colatz conjecture for all integers  
COLNEW - a version of COLTES with a more efficient method for determining odd and even numbers  
*note: I havent been able to get either of the two previous programs to run past 64 ever since I updated the OS on my calculator*  
*funny story: COLNEW once ran until the calculator ran out of battery which clears the ram and all programs*  
*TLDR: COLNEW managed to delete itself*  
CRASHD - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
DECBIN - decimal to binary conveter  
DECHEX - decimal to Hex converter  
EVNODD - displays whether the number is even or odd using method in COLNEW  
FOR - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
FRCSEP - input a fraction, outputs numeratior to N and denominator to D. I don't remember why I made this
GRDDES - prank program to transer to an unlucky friend's calculator. Messus up graph settings and draws a bunch of junk graphs
GRDFIX - empty. was intended to fix the graph after GRDDES
HALFEC - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
KEKKEK - simple endless function for entertaimnet/battery-wasitng purposes  
KEKYOU - more battery wasting fun  
LENCON - length unit coveter. amde before i knew how to use menu(  
LOLOO - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
MENUUU - stupid test, technically broken. requires pic 1 and 2  
ONESEC - function to manually wait one second. Lasts too long ever since the update  
PRFIND - finds all prime numbers in succession starting with the given number  
PRIME - finds all factors of a number. not sure of difference between BIGFCT  
REFFIN - finds reference angles? Sure wish I remembered that lesson from trig  
RKPRSC - game of rock paper scissors with a few random additions  
STRSTR - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
TEST - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
TRIALS - my first assembly program  
TRIANG - triangle solver  
USERS - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
WAVESY - used to be an animation of a stick figure waving. Requires pic 3 4 and 5.  
*this program is proof that the update changed how TI BASIC is compiled becuse it runs abotu 1/3 the speed it used to*
